## Dataset classification

By access:

- public - Available for download by anyone without any explicit restrictions on use or redistribution. Where implicit copyright applies, publisher appears to be uninterested in enforcing it.
- licensed - Available only after accepting license that contains confidentiality terms. This includes all datasets that cost money. License may include other restrictions in addition to confidentiality.
- secret - Secret dataset itself cannot be obtained, but algorithms can be submitted for evaluation on the dataset. All competition datasets are secret to prevent cheating.

By impression count:

- rectangular dataset - There are more than two impressions per finger. Rectangular datasets have certain advantages in research due to the large number of matching pairs.
- pairset - There are two impressions per finger. All natural datasets and thus all large datasets are pairsets.
- latent dataset - Latent datasets contain latent fingerprints taken from objects. They typically do not identify finger, only subject. They are usually intended to be matched against plain/rolled fingerprints from another dataset.

- Size: 200 subjects x 50 impressions
- Impression type: latent, finger and palm
- Format: PNG, 1000-1500dpi
- License: [simple confidentiality rules](https://nigos.nist.gov/datasets/sd302/request)
