## Dataset classification

By access:

- public - Available for download by anyone without having to pay or sign restrictive license.
- restricted - Available only after completing some kind of transaction, for example purchase of a product or signing restrictive agreement.
- secret - Fingerprints themselves cannot be obtained, but developers can submit algorithms to be evaluated on the dataset.

By impression count:

- rectangular dataset - Dataset has more than two impressions per finger. Rectangular datasets have some advantages in research.
- pairset - There are two impressions per finger. All natural datasets and thus all large datasets are pairsets.
